    <string name="bio">I am a software developer with a solid academic foundation in Computer Science and a demonstrated history of working with
Java since 2014, from startups to multinational companies. In my last position as a LISP Implementation Specialist, I coded in a
functional programming language called LISP, which is famous for being used for AI applications and inspiring advanced features
for modern languages, like Lambda and mapping. Also, I have coded in various programming languages, like C, Ruby, SAS,
ShellScript and Python, by instance, and different programming paradigms like OOP, database SQL, procedural, functional, and
logical. I am also used to working in an Agile environment using Scrum methodologies and have strong communication and
management skills. I aim for a position as a developer in a company that challenges me with innovation and out-of-the-box
problems.
